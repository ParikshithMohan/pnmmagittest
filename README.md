# clj-pnm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theparanoidtimes/clj-pnm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theparanoidtimes/clj-pnm)

A Clojure library for reading and writing Netpbm files.

Reads a *pnm* file into a Clojure structure. That same structure
can be used to write a *pnm* file. Currently supports *p1* (*.pbm*),
*p2* (*.pgm*) and *p3* (*.ppm*) files.

Good explanation of the format and the documents that are used as guides
for this library can be found [here](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html)
and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format).

The library is still in its early stages, so any feedback and support is
welcome.

## Usage

Read a *test.pbm* file

```
P1
2
2
1 1
1 1
```

``` clojure
(require '[clj-pnm.core :as pnm])
=> nil

(pnm/read-pnm (io/file "test.pnm"))
=> {:type :p1, :width 2, :height 2, :map [[1 1] [1 1]]}
```

Read a *test.pgm* file

```
P2
3
2
4
1 2 3
4 3 2
```

``` clojure
(pnm/read-pnm (io/file "test.pgm"))
=> {:type :p2, :width 3, :height 2, :max-value 4, :map [[1 2 3] [4 3 2]]}
```

Finally, read a *test.ppm* file

```
P3
2
2
255
255 0 255 128 52 123
0 0 0 45 45 45
```

``` clojure
(pnm/read-pnm (io/file "test.ppm"))
=> {:type :p3
    :width 2
    :height 2
    :max-value 255
    :map [[(255 0 255) (128 52 123)]
          [(0 0 0) (45 45 45)]]} ;; prettified
```

It can extract comments if necessary

```
P1
1
1
# A comment
# Another comment
1
```

``` clojure
(pnm/get-comments (pnm/read-file (io/file "comment.pbm")))
=> ("A comment" "Another comment")
```

Writing a file is just a matter of passing a map like the ones explained
above. It can include comments also which are always written after the header part.

``` clojure
(pnm/write-pnm {:type :p1 :width 1 :height 1 :map [[1]]} "out.pbm")
=> ...out.pbm file...

(slurp *1)
=> "P1
    1
    1
    1" ;; prettified

(pnm/write-pnm {:type :p3 :width 1 :height 1 :max-value 255:map [[1]]} "out.ppm", #{"A comment" "Another comment"})
=> ...out.ppm file...

(slurp *1)
=> "P3
    1
    1
    255
    # Another comment
    # A comment
    255 255 255" ;; prettified
```
